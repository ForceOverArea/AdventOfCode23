# AdventOfCode23
My submissions for Advent of Code 2023.

All solutions will be written in Fortran... for better or worse.

Tweaks may be made after my initial solution for optimization, readability, etc.

### Compiling
Each can be built with the GNU Fortran compiler (gfortran). 
A shell script to build the solution is present in each folder to automatically compile all the needed code.

In Bash:
```shell
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
./dayXpX
```
Note that each solution will need to be built in locally in the folder for the given day.
